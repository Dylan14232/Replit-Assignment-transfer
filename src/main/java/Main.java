// Exercise 1 A:
  public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
      int h = 5; 
      int s = 6; 
      int sum = h + s; 
      System.out.println(" > " + "The sum of the two variables is" + "  " + sum);
 //   }
 // } 

// Exercise 1 B:
  // public class Main {
    // public static void main(String[] args) {
      int x = 10; 
      int y = 30; 
      double z = 30.99;
      double total = x + y + z;
      System.out.println(" > " + "The total of the three variables is " + total); 
 //   }
 // } 
//  1 B notes: the exercise starts using Standard java syntax. Int's are assigned to x and y given the variables 10, and 30 ending with the break or ";". As required I have added a third variable that is labled as double and assigned to 30.99 also ending with ";". Since the double was added the sum line will also be a double as the print statement will add the sum and produce a double variable for the output. I also added in the print statement the " > ". The " " insert the symbole before the actual print statement to match the output.


// Exercise 1 C:
 // 
 // public class Main {
   // public static void main(String[] args) {
     boolean isJavaFun = true;
     boolean isFishTasty = false;
     System.out.println(" > " + isJavaFun);
     System.out.println("   " + isFishTasty);   
//   }
// }
// Exercise 1 C notes: Using the standard java syntax, I created two boolean variables and assigned them to true or false. To match the desired output I used println statements to get each print statement on a new line. I then used " " to insert the > symbole to true to match the output. I also used " " to add a space before the false statement to make sure false printed directly under true and not > in the true print statement.

// Exercise 1 D: 


 // public class Main {
   // public static void main(String[] args) {
     char myVar1 = 65, myVar2 = 66, myVar3 = 67;
     System.out.print(myVar1);
     System.out.print(myVar2);
     System.out.print(myVar3);  
//   }
// }
// Exercise 1 D notes: Using the standard java syntax, I created three char variables as instructed in the assignment and assigned them values. I tried several ways to do this but they ended up adding the values and not printing them as a char. I ended up creating three print statements each for each char vairable without the newline command or the space commands. The result for the code was ABC.

// Exercise 1 E:

  // public class Main {
    // public static void main(String[] args) {
      int high = 44;
          int low = 32;
          if (high > low) 
              System.out.println(" > " + "Int high is true.");
           else 
              System.out.println(" > " + "Error.");   
 //       }
 //     }

// for ecercise 1 E, im not sure if i coded it correctly as i only coded the print statement for true to be outputted or an error to be outputted, however it did give me the desired output. I was trying to use an interactive if elif else statement to add to the user interface to make the code more user firendly however i was not able to get the code to work that way.
    

// Exercise 1 F: 
 
   // public class Main {
     // public static void main(String[] args) {
       var first = "Dylan";
       var last = "Deavers";
       var full = first  + " " + last;
       System.out.println(" > " + full);
     // }
   // } 
// for exercise 1 f i tried using the let keyword, and i tried creating the strings without the keywords as well (ex first_name = "Dylan"). Only var would allow my code to run. if i tried the keyword let, it would not run. I assigned var to first, last and full, on the full line i used quotations for a space and to insert > before my name. I also used + to add the two trings togeather to get my full name on one print line.


// Exercise 1 G:
   // public class Main {
     // public static void main(String[] args) {
       String a = "90";
       int b = 40;
       String c = a + b;
       System.out.println(" > " + c);
  //   }
  // } 
// Exercise 1 G notes: As followed in the assignment, i created a string var and assigned it to 90. I then created an int var and assigned it to 40, then i created a string var and assigned it to the sum of the two var's. Lastly i used the print statement to print the result. The reult was 9040.


// Exercise 1 H:
  // public class Main {
    // public static void main(String[] args) {
      String statement = (" > " + "That \"dog\" just meeowed!");
      System.out.println(statement);   
    

   
// Exercise 1 H notes: I created a string var and assigned it to the statement line. I used the \"\" to add quotations to the word dog in the sentence. I used the print line to print the statement to get the desired output for the exercise.

// Exercise 1 I:
   // public class Main {
     // public static void main(String[] args) {
       int t = 22;
       int q = 10;
       if (t > q);
           System.out.print(" > " + "t is greater than q");
     }
   }

// Exercise 1 I notes: I am not sure if i coded this one correctly. I tried using and if elif else statement to add to the user interface to make the code more user firendly. I have the if statement in there but when i tired using else or elif it would say they were not attached to the if statement i have above. I got the if statement to work and as far as i know if the valuse comes out greater than x the code does not print. I am not sure if i coded it correctly or if i did it right.
